# FNP Sales Analysis Dashboard
### Overview
The FNP Sales Analysis Dashboard is an interactive Excel-based reporting tool developed to monitor, analyze, and visualize sales performance across various dimensions including time, geography, occasion, product categories, and customer behavior. It helps business stakeholders derive insights, track KPIs, and make informed decisions to optimize operations and marketing efforts.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
